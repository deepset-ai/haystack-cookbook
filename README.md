A collection of example notebooks using [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) 💚

These examples can serve as guidelines for using different model providers, vector databases, retrieval techniques, new experimental features, and more with Haystack. Most showcase a specific, small demo.

## How to Contribute a Cookbook

If you have an example that uses Haystack, you can add it to this repository by creating a PR. 
> You can also create a PR directly from Colab by creating a fork of this repository and selecting "Save a Copy to GitHub" on Colab. Once you add your example to your fork, you can create a PR on this repository. 

1. Add your notebook to `/notebooks` folder
2. Give a descriptive name to your file that includes the names of (if applicable) the model providers, databases, the technologies you use in your example, and/or the task you are completing in the example.
3. Make sure you add it to `index.toml`, including its title and topics. If the notebook is using an experimental feature, also add the discussion link with the `experimental = true` field.
