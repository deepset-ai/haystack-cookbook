    "This notebook demonstrates how a Haystack Agent can interactively ask for user input when it's uncertain about the next step. We'll build a Human-in-the-Loop tool that the Agent can call dynamically. When the Agent encounters ambiguity or incomplete information, it will use a system prompt and trigger human feedback to continue solving the task.\n",

    "The support Agent is created using Haystack Tools and Agent and will perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for any failed CI workflows\n",
    "- Fetch build logs and status\n",
    "- Lookup and analyze git commits\n",
