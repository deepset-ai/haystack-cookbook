    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Traditional Lead Research:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales teams today face a perfect storm of challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LinkedIn Crackdowns**: Recent lawsuits and aggressive anti-scraping measures have killed most LinkedIn data tools, leaving sales teams in the dark\n",
    "- **Expensive SaaS Tools**: Traditional lead intelligence platforms like ZoomInfo, Apollo.io, and Seamless.AI cost $500-2,000+ per month per seat\n",
    "- **Manual Research is Slow**: Researching a single prospect manually takes 30-45 minutes - time most sales teams don't have\n",
    "- **Data Gets Stale Fast**: By the time you buy a lead list, key decision makers may have changed roles\n",
    "- **Compliance Concerns**: Many scraping tools operate in legal gray areas, putting your company at risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Compliant, Cost-Effective Alternative:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates how to build your own AI-powered sales research agent that:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Extracts live data** from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, news sources, and job postings  \n",
    "✅ **Stays compliant** using Bright Data's ethical, robots.txt-respecting infrastructure  \n",
    "✅ **Costs ~$0.50 per company** researched (vs $50-100/month per lead in traditional tools)  \n",
    "✅ **Provides deeper insights** by combining multiple data sources with AI analysis  \n",
    "✅ **Answers complex questions** like \"What pain points is this company facing?\" and \"Generate a personalized outreach angle\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Tech Stack:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌐 Bright Data**: Compliant web scraping for 45+ data sources (LinkedIn, Crunchbase, news, job boards)\n",
    "- **🍃 MongoDB Atlas**: Vector database for semantic search + structured metadata filtering\n",
    "- **🔧 Haystack**: Open-source LLM framework for building RAG pipelines and AI agents\n",
    "- **🤖 Google Gemini 2.0**: Generate actionable sales intelligence from raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this cookbook, you'll have a working sales research agent that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find companies** matching your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) criteria\n",
    "2. **Identify decision makers** and research their backgrounds\n",
    "3. **Extract pain points** from job postings, news articles, and company data\n",
    "4. **Generate personalized outreach** angles based on comprehensive company intelligence\n",

    "## MongoDB Atlas Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB Atlas will serve as our vector database, storing both the embedded representations of our lead data and structured metadata for hybrid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why MongoDB Atlas for Sales Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity matching to find leads based on meaning, not just keywords\n",
    "- **Metadata Filtering**: Combine semantic search with structured filters (industry, funding stage, location, etc.)\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Handle millions of leads with sub-second query times\n",
    "- **Flexible Schema**: Store varying data structures from different sources (Crunchbase, LinkedIn, news)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have one yet, follow the [Get Started with Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) guide to:\n",
    "- Create a free cluster (M0 tier is sufficient for testing)\n",
    "- Set up database access credentials\n",
    "- Configure network access (allow your IP or use 0.0.0.0/0 for testing)\n",
    "- Get your connection string\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Create Search Indexes**\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB Atlas requires two types of search indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Vector Search Index** (for semantic search)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your cluster in the Atlas UI\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Search\" tab → \"Create Search Index\"\n",
    "3. Choose \"Atlas Vector Search\" → \"JSON Editor\"\n",
    "4. Use this configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"lead_vector_index\",\n",
    "  \"type\": \"vectorSearch\",\n",
    "  \"fields\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"vector\",\n",
    "      \"path\": \"embedding\",\n",
    "      \"numDimensions\": 768,\n",
    "      \"similarity\": \"cosine\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Full-Text Search Index** (for keyword filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click \"Create Search Index\" again\n",
    "2. Choose \"Atlas Search\" → \"JSON Editor\"\n",
    "3. Use this configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"lead_fulltext_index\",\n",
    "  \"mappings\": {\n",
    "    \"dynamic\": true\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We're using 768 dimensions for vector search because that's the output size of Google's `text-embedding-004` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Schema Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Our documents will have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"content\": \"Company: Example Inc\\nDescription: AI-powered...\\nIndustry: AI/ML...\",\n",
    "  \"embedding\": [0.123, -0.456, ...],  # 768-dimensional vector\n",
    "  \"meta\": {\n",
    "    \"source_url\": \"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/example\",\n",

    "    \"scraped_date\": \"2026-01-19\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows us to:\n",
    "- Search semantically via the `embedding` field\n",
    "- Filter by metadata (industry, funding stage, location)\n",
    "- Display rich context from the `content` field\n",
    "\n",

    "### ⚠️ Critical Step: Create the Vector Search Index in Atlas UI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MongoDBAtlasDocumentStore` expects a pre-configured vector search index. If you skip this step, your queries will return empty results even though documents are stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas UI**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to your cluster \n",
    "   - Click the **\"Search\"** tab (not \"Browse Collections\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Vector Search Index**:\n",
    "   - Click \"Create Search Index\"\n",
    "   - Select \"Atlas Vector Search\" → \"JSON Editor\"\n",
    "   - Index name: `lead_vector_index`\n",
    "   - Database: `sales_intelligence` (must match your `database_name` parameter)\n",
    "   - Collection: `leads` (must match your `collection_name` parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Index Configuration** (paste in JSON editor):\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"fields\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"type\": \"vector\",\n",
    "      \"path\": \"embedding\",\n",
    "      \"numDimensions\": 768,\n",
    "      \"similarity\": \"cosine\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wait for Index to Build**: The index status should change from \"Building\" to \"Active\" before running queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is how it should look like after setup**: \n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](../data/ai_sales_research_agent_assets/mongo_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting**: If retrieval returns 0 documents:\n",
    "- Verify the index name matches exactly: `lead_vector_index`\n",
    "- Confirm the database and collection names match your code\n",
    "- Check that the index status is \"Active\" (not \"Building\" or \"Failed\")\n",
    "- Ensure `numDimensions: 768` matches the embedding model output\n",

    "## Bright Data Scraping Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our database configured, let's set up the data collection layer using Bright Data's web scraping infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Bright Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web scraping approaches face significant challenges:\n",
    "- **IP Blocks**: Websites detect and block scrapers\n",
    "- **CAPTCHAs**: Anti-bot measures prevent automated access\n",
    "- **Geo-Restrictions**: Content varies by location\n",
    "- **Legal Risks**: Non-compliant scraping violates terms of service\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: Website structure changes break scrapers\n",
    "\n",
    "Bright Data solves these problems with:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Compliant Infrastructure**: Respects robots.txt and website policies  \n",
    "✅ **Automatic CAPTCHA Solving**: Handles anti-bot challenges automatically  \n",
    "✅ **Geo-Targeting**: Access content from specific countries/regions  \n",
    "✅ **IP Rotation**: Built-in proxy network prevents blocks  \n",
    "✅ **Structured Data**: Returns clean JSON, not raw HTML  \n",
    "✅ **Maintained Scrapers**: Updates when websites change  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources for Sales Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "For our sales research agent, we'll use three Bright Data capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Web Scraper API** (Structured Data Extraction)\n",
    "- Pre-built scrapers for 45+ platforms\n",
    "- Returns structured JSON data\n",
    "- Datasets we'll use:\n",
    "  - `crunchbase_company`: Funding, investors, employee count\n",
    "  - `linkedin_company_profile`: Industry, size, description\n",
    "  - `linkedin_person_profile`: Decision maker profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. SERP API** (Search Engine Results)\n",
    "- Real-time Google/Bing search results\n",
    "- Geo-targeted queries\n",
    "- Use cases:\n",
    "  - Recent company news and press releases\n",
    "  - Job postings (hiring signals)\n",
    "  - Industry trends and mentions\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Web Unlocker** (Optional - for custom scraping)\n",
    "- Access any public website\n",
    "- Bypasses bot detection\n",
    "- Returns HTML, markdown, or screenshots\n",
    "- Useful for company blogs, career pages, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compliance & Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "Bright Data operates within legal boundaries:\n",
    "- ✅ Only accesses publicly available data\n",
    "- ✅ Respects robots.txt directives\n",
    "- ✅ Complies with GDPR, CCPA regulations\n",
    "- ✅ Does not circumvent authentication or paywalls\n",
    "- ✅ Transparent infrastructure audited by third parties\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important given recent LinkedIn lawsuits against scraping services. Bright Data's compliant approach provides legal protection for your sales operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start scraping!"

    "## Data Processing & Indexing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can scrape data from multiple sources (Crunchbase, LinkedIn, SERP), we need to **process** and **index** it into MongoDB Atlas for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Indexing Pipeline Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Raw Scraped Data → Document Creation → Embedding Generation → MongoDB Storage\n",
    "     (JSON)            (Haystack)         (Gemini 768d)         (Vector DB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Index Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without Indexing:**\n",
    "- Data sits as raw JSON\n",
    "- No semantic search capability\n",
    "- Can't answer questions like \"Find AI startups in NYC\"\n",
    "- No RAG pipeline possible\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Indexing:**\n",
    "- ✅ Semantic search across all companies/people\n",
    "- ✅ Hybrid filtering (vector similarity + metadata)\n",
    "- ✅ Feed relevant context to Gemini for intelligent answers\n",
    "- ✅ Build RAG pipeline for sales intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Structure Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Each document in MongoDB has three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"content\": \"Human-readable text about company/person\",\n",
    "  \"embedding\": [0.123, -0.456, ...],  # 768-dimensional vector\n",
    "  \"meta\": {\n",
    "    \"source_url\": \"...\",\n",
    "    \"dataset_type\": \"crunchbase_company\",\n",
    "    \"company_name\": \"...\",\n",
    "    \"industry\": \"...\",\n",
    "    \"funding_stage\": \"...\",\n",
    "    \"location\": \"...\",\n",
    "    \"scraped_date\": \"2026-01-19\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Extract & Transform** 📦\n",
    "- Take raw JSON from scraper\n",
    "- Extract key fields (name, industry, funding, etc.)\n",
    "- Create human-readable content string\n",
    "- Structure metadata for filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Generate Embeddings** 🧠\n",
    "- Pass content through Google's text-embedding-004\n",
    "- Get 768-dimensional vector representation\n",
    "- Captures semantic meaning for similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Store in MongoDB** 💾\n",
    "- Write document with content, embedding, and metadata\n",
    "- Automatically indexed by vector search index\n",
    "- Ready for hybrid search queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing Pipeline Component\n",
    "\n",
    "Haystack provides an **indexing pipeline** that automates this flow:\n",
    "\n",

    "## RAG Pipeline for Sales Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have company and person data indexed in MongoDB, let's build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to answer sales intelligence questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG combines **retrieval** (finding relevant documents) with **generation** (using an LLM to synthesize answers). This enables the AI to answer questions based on your specific data, not just general knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without RAG:**\n",
    "- ❌ LLM only knows general information\n",
    "- ❌ Can't answer \"What companies in my database are in fintech?\"\n",
    "- ❌ No personalized sales insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**With RAG:**\n",
    "- ✅ LLM accesses your scraped company/person data\n",
    "- ✅ Answers questions based on real, indexed information\n",
    "- ✅ Provides personalized sales intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Pipeline Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Question → Text Embedder → Retriever → Prompt Builder → LLM Generator → Answer\n",
    "    (str)         (768d vec)     (MongoDB)    (Context)       (Gemini)      (str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Question**: \"Find AI startups in NYC with Series A funding\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Embedder**: Converts question to 768-dimensional embedding\n",
    "   - Uses same model as indexing (text-embedding-004)\n",
    "   - Enables semantic similarity matching\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retriever**: Searches MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "   - Vector search: Find semantically similar companies\n",
    "   - Metadata filters: Apply exact criteria (location=NYC, funding_stage=Series A)\n",
    "   - Returns top-k most relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompt Builder**: Constructs LLM prompt\n",
    "   - Combines user question with retrieved context\n",
    "   - Template: \"Based on these companies: {context}, answer: {question}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **LLM Generator**: Gemini 2.0 synthesizes answer\n",
    "   - Reads retrieved company data\n",
    "   - Generates natural language response\n",
    "   - Cites specific companies and details\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Answer**: \"I found 3 AI startups in NYC with Series A funding: Company X (raised $10M), Company Y...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Text Embedder** (`GoogleGenAITextEmbedder`)\n",
    "- Input: User's question (string)\n",
    "- Output: 768-dimensional vector\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Retriever** (`MongoDBAtlasEmbeddingRetriever`)\n",
    "- Input: Query embedding + optional filters\n",
    "- Output: Top-k relevant documents\n",
    "- Purpose: Find similar companies/people from vector DB\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Prompt Builder** (`PromptBuilder`)\n",
    "- Input: Retrieved documents + user question\n",
    "- Output: Formatted prompt for LLM\n",
    "- Purpose: Structure context for generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Generator** (`GoogleGenAIChatGenerator`)\n",
    "- Input: Prompt with context\n",
    "- Output: Natural language answer\n",
    "- Purpose: Synthesize insights from retrieved data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Once built, our RAG pipeline can answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Company Discovery**: \"Find AI companies in San Francisco with 50-100 employees\"\n",
    "- **Decision Maker Search**: \"Who are the VPs of Engineering at fintech companies?\"\n",
    "- **Pain Point Analysis**: \"What companies are hiring for data engineering roles?\"\n",
    "- **Personalized Outreach**: \"Generate a sales pitch for Company X based on their profile\"\n",
