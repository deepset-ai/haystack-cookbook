      "1. Product was great. Love the options. anything I could imagine was available. my only issue was I paid extra for 4-6 shipping and got the shirts 9 days after order. I will try again tho.Thank you\n",

      "3. Love the way everything was packed nicely folded with fast efficient delivery.\n",
      "4. A bit pricey for a tee shirt. Childs size cost $18.00 and outrageous shipping $9.99. No way this cost that much to ship in a plastic bag. Would likely not use again due to shipping charges. Only bought from this site as I could not find it on Amazon or elsewhere. Hard to say how well print will hold up to washing. This was\n",
      "5. Fast service, the shirt is great, exactly as shown.Too many promotional emails though.\n",
      "6. Awesome selection and I loved how it turned out!And fast shipping! I will be visiting again!\n",
      "7. I like this company and the fact that I am supporting local artists.My only negative is that shipping takes too long for the rates charged.\n",
      "8. Fast shipping, great quality, but the sizing was WAY off - my shirt doesn't fit me whatsoever.\n",
      "9. The tee that I originally ordered was at least 2 sizes smaller than the size it is supposed to be.The exchange went nice and easy but the second tee sent to me was just a a little larger but still small.You need to have tees that are more true to size. I can't wear either one.Love the design.\n",
      "10. The shirts are perfect. Well made. Quality shirts. The prints are awesome. Definitely a repeat customer.\n"
