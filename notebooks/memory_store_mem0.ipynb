    "# Using Mem0 Memory Store with Haystack Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) is a managed memory layer for AI agents. Instead of passing entire conversation histories to an LLM on every turn, Mem0 intelligently extracts and compresses key facts from conversations into optimized memory representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Mem0 manages a cycle of **extraction**, **consolidation**, and **retrieval**. When new messages arrive, relevant facts are identified and stored. Over time, memories are merged, updated, or allowed to fade if they lose relevance. When the agent later needs context, Mem0 surfaces only the memories most relevant to the current query, helping to keep token usage and latency low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a `Mem0MemoryStore` and add memories about a user\n",
    "2. Inspect what Mem0 actually stored\n",
    "3. Create a Haystack Agent that uses the memory store\n",
    "4. Ask the Agent personalized questions and see how it leverages stored memories"

    "\n",
    "- **What is stored** - A retriever pulls chunks from a knowledge base built on top of your documents. A memory store holds distilled facts learned from conversations, like user preferences, past decisions, stated goals, but not raw documents.\n",
    "- **Who it belongs to** - Retrieved documents are typically shared across all users. Memories are scoped to a specific user, agent, or session, enabling personalization.\n",
    "- **How it evolves** - A document store changes only when you explicitly index new content. A memory store evolves automatically as the agent converses: new facts are extracted, conflicting ones are updated, and low-relevance memories decay over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the two are complementary. A Haystack Agent can use a retriever to answer factual questions from your knowledge base while using a memory store to remember who it is talking to and what they care about."
