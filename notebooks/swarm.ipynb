    "## Tools and Routines\n",
    "\n",
    "The term Agent has a broad definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to qualify as an Agent, a software application built on a Language Model should go beyond simply generating text; it must also be capable of performing actions, such as executing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular way of doing this is **Tool calling**:\n",
    "1. We provide a set of tools (functions, APIs with a given spec) to the model.\n",
    "2. The model prepares function calls based on user request and available tools.\n",
    "3. Actual invocation is executed outside the model (at the Agent level).\n",
    "4. The model can further elaborate on the result of the invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on tool support in Haystack, check out the [documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm introduces **routines**, which are natural-language instructions paired with the tools needed to execute them. Below, we’ll build an agent capable of calling tools and executing routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `instructions` could already be passed to the Assistant, to guide its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Agent introduces a new init parameter called `functions`. These functions are automatically converted into Tools. Key difference: to be passed to a Language Model, a Tool must have a name, a description and JSON schema specifying its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During initialization, we also create a `ToolInvoker`. This Haystack component takes in Chat Messages containing prepared `tool_calls`, performs the tool invocation and wraps the results in Chat Message with `tool` role.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What happens during `run`? The agent first generates a response. If the response includes tool calls, these are executed, and the results are integrated into the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `while` loop manages user interactions:\n",
    "  - If the last message role is `assistant`, it waits for user input.\n",
    "  - If the last message role is `tool`, it continues running to handle tool execution and its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This implementation differs from the original approach by making the Agent responsible for invoking tools directly, instead of delegating control to the `while` loop.*\n",
