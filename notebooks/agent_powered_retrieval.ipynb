        "In this notebook, you'll build an intelligent **movie recommendation assistant** powered by **Haystack** and [**Qdrant**](https://haystack.deepset.ai/integrations/qdrant-document-store). You'll learn how to combine **sparse vector search**, **metadata filtering (payload)**, and **LLM-based agents** to create a system that can understand natural language queries and recommend relevant movies from a curated dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you‚Äôll have a fully working assistant that can answer queries like:\n",

        "  * **Language constraints** (e.g., \"only English movies\")\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use `query` when the user describes:\n",
        "  * **Plot or story themes** (e.g., \"a movie about friendship and betrayal\")\n",
        "  * **Emotions or tone** (e.g., \"feel-good\", \"dark comedy\")\n",
        "  * **Character types or settings** (e.g., \"set in space\", \"female-led action\")\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use both `query` and `metadata_filters` if there is enough information in the user query for both `query` and `metadata_filters`.\n",
        "- If the user asks for a specific number of movies, set that value as `top_k`.\n",
